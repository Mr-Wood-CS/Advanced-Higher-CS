# Object-Oriented Programming

## Explanation

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects and data rather than logic.​
​
The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects the programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other, an exercise often known as data modelling. ​
​
Once an object has been identified,  it is generalized as a class of objects which defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. ​
​
Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. ​

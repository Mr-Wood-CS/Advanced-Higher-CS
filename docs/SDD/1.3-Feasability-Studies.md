### ==Explanation==

The creation of a new system can take months (or even years) and cost thousands (or millions!) of pounds. The basic purpose of a feasibility study is to ascertain whether such expenditure of time and money is likely to prove worthwhile and whether the objectives of the problem definition can actually be realised – what some companies want might be unrealistic and unachievable. 

A feasibility study should be relatively cheap and quick to carry out. It should be complete in itself and the client does not have to commit to any further expenditure or long-term development by commissioning one – the client has no legal or contractual obligation to take developments further. 

Another advantage of a feasibility study is that it can present the client with a range of possibilities from which a choice can be made. 

Often, several different solutions will be considered in a feasibility study before a recommendation is made. 

!!! info "Key Points"

    * The feasibility study should be conducted relatively cheaply and within a fairly short time frame. 

    * There are no legal or contractual requirements at this stage.

    * The findings of the feasibility study are presented to the client in the form of a report.

    * This report indicates costs, benefits, alternatives and appropriate recommendations.

### ==The Four Aspects of a Feasibility Study==

There are four aspects of feasibility that must be considered in any feasibility study:

=== "Economic Feasability"

    This deals with the cost implications involved. Management will want to know how much each option will cost, what is affordable within the company’s budget and what they get for their money. 
    A cost-benefit-analysis is part of the budgetary feasibility study. If the project is not cost-effective then there is no point proceeding. Setting up a new computer system is an investment and involves capital outlay. 
    
    The costs of a new system include:
    
    • the costs of acquiring it in the first place (consultancy fees, program development including cost of any resources required for development, etc.)
    
    • the costs of installing it (disruption of current operations, cost of new equipment, alteration of workplace, etc.)
    
    * the costs of maintaining it which also includes training. 
    
    In the long term, management will also want to know the ‘break-even point’ when the new system stops costing money and starts to make money. 
    
    ==This is extremely difficult to quantify.==
    
    However, an accurate estimate of a system’s operational life span is a valid option and will rely solely on the knowledge and experience of the systems analyst involved.

!!! info "Key Points"
    
    * The client will want to know the cost of each option and what they get for their money.

    *  A system is only economically feasible if the benefits of the development outweigh the costs. For this reason a cost benefit analysis is carried out.

=== "Legal Feasability"

    This considers the legal issues associated with the development of a new information system. Particular notice must be given to the legislation outlined in:

    GDPR

    * Will the new system contain details of living persons?

    Computer Misuse Act (1990)

    * The potential for hacking and plating viruses must be considered.

    Copyright, Design and Patents Act (1988)

    * The issue of software licensing is important.

=== "Technical Feasability"

    The technical feasibility study must identify the technologies that will be necessary for the proposed system to function correctly. 

    Once identified, the technical feasibility then considers whether or not the technologies necessary are currently available.

    * If the required technologies are available, the technical feasibility must determine whether or not the client already has the necessary resources. If not, the resources that must be acquired are identified and suitable hardware and software recommended.

=== "Time Feasability"

    The time necessary to develop a new information system is considerable. For this reason, the time feasibility must consider not only the time needed to carry out the development but how this will affect the client.

    Time feasibility must take account of:
    
    * overall development time for the project
    * events during the year that the business is already committed to
    * when best to install the new system
    * when is the best time to train users how to use the new system
    * when will the  system be ready for use.

### ==User Survey==

The users of a particular program are the best people to identify the existing problems with the software and how it could be improved.

If the software being developed is new, the target user group should understand the programme. 

> For example, a new library system would be developed following some time spent capturing the experience of existing librarians and how they operate.

When the opinion of a number of users is required, it is often easier to create a survey or questionnaire which will capture the information that the project team require.

# 2d Arrays

## Explanation

A 2D array is like a table or grid, made up of rows and columns. Each position in a 2D array can hold a value, much like how a cell in a spreadsheet works. 

This allows us to store and work with data efficiently.

!!! example "Example - A Chessboard"

        Imagine a chessboard, which has 8 rows and 8 columns. Each square on the board can hold a piece (like a pawn or bishop), and each piece can be positioned at a specific spot determined by its row and column number.

> Row 1, Column 1 might hold a white rook.


> Row 2, Column 3 might hold a black knight.

This is exactly how a 2D array works! 

== Each cell can be accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column. ==

## How Does it Work?

Let’s say we want to create an array to store students’ scores in different subjects. We could set it up like this:

Subjects         Maths  English  ScienceStudents   1       85      78      92   2       76      81      88   3       90      83      95
In code, this could be represented as:

scores = [  [85, 78, 92],   // Scores for Student 1  [76, 81, 88],   // Scores for Student 2  [90, 83, 95]    // Scores for Student 3]
Here, scores[0][1] would give us 78, which is the score for Student 1 in English.

Why Use 2D Arrays?

Structured Data: They help organise data in a way that's easy to manage.
Efficient Access: You can quickly access information if you know the row and column.
Useful in Real-life Applications: They are used in games, graphics, and databases.
Practical Example: Seating Arrangements

Imagine organising a classroom. You could represent the seats with a 2D array, where each seat has a number:

        Seat 1  Seat 2  Seat 3Row 1     A        B        CRow 2     D        E        F
In code, this arrangement could look like:

seats = [  ['A', 'B', 'C'],   // Row 1  ['D', 'E', 'F']    // Row 2]
You can find out who is sitting in Seat 2 of Row 1 by checking seats[0][1], which will show you B.

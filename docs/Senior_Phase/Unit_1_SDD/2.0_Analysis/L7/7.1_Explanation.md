    Describe, exemplify, and implement research for:
 
    * feasibility studies:
		* economic
		* time
		* legal
		* technical
    * user surveys

### ==Explanation==

The creation of a new system can take months (or even years) and cost thousands (or millions!) of pounds. The basic purpose of a feasibility study is to ascertain whether such expenditure of time and money is likely to prove worthwhile and whether the objectives of the problem definition can actually be realised – what some companies want might be unrealistic and unachievable. 
	
A feasibility study should be relatively cheap and quick to carry out. It should be complete in itself and the client does not have to commit to any further expenditure or long-term development by commissioning one – the client has no legal or contractual obligation to take developments further. 
	
Another advantage of a feasibility study is that it can present the client with a range of possibilities from which a choice can be made. 
	
Often, several different solutions will be considered in a feasibility study before a recommendation is made. 
	
!!! info "Key Points"
	
    * The feasibility study should be conducted relatively cheaply and within a fairly short time frame. 
	
    * There are no legal or contractual requirements at this stage.
	
    * The findings of the feasibility study are presented to the client in the form of a report.
	
    * This report indicates costs, benefits, alternatives and appropriate recommendations.

### ==Aspects of a Feasibility Study==

There are four aspects of feasibility that must be considered in any feasibility study:

The users of a particular program are the best people to identify the existing problems with the software and how it could be improved.

If the software being developed is new, the target user group should understand the programme. 

> For example, a new library system would be developed following some time spent capturing the experience of existing librarians and how they operate.

When the opinion of a number of users is required, it is often easier to create a survey or questionnaire which will capture the information that the project team require.

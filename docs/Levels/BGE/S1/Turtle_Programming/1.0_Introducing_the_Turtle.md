# Introducing the Turtle

## The Turtle

This term, you will start developing your knowledge of Python code to learn how to draw graphics on to the computer screen. 

To do this, you will be using the Turtle module – which is simply an extra part of Python. 

A module is a library of code written by a very intelligent person. 

We need to import the functions (snippets of code) inside of the library so that we can use these extra features in our code. 

## Importing the Turtle

To import all of the functions in the Turtle module, we need to add the following line of code to the start of every program we write this term:

``` python
from turtle import *
```

This line reads “**from the turtle module, import all of the functions inside of it.**” 

This means you will have access to all the code to allow you to draw graphics on the screen.

## What the Turtle Looks Like

When you run your first program with the Turtle, you will see a little symbol appear on the screen that will draw your graphics. 

`Even though it doesn’t look like one, this is the **Turtle**.`

## What can the Turtle do?

The Turtle is a great way to learn how to code using Python. 

By using graphics, it’s a bit more interesting that the usual boring text you see on the screen when coding. 

The Turtle is capable of drawing almost anything you dream up – you just need to know how to code it! 

Cool 2D artworks and amazing patterns are just some of the things that the Turtle is capable of drawing.

In this lesson we are going to concentrate on getting to grips with the Python language and how we can solve problems when things go wrong.

To do this we will be using the `Raspberry Pi Code Editor`

## Using the Raspberry Pi Code Editor

The Raspberry Pi Code Editor is a tool designed to help you write and run Python code on your Raspberry Pi. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where you can create new Python programs, edit existing ones, and see the results immediately. 

You can use it to practice writing Python, explore different programming concepts, and even work with hardware projects. The editor makes it easy for both beginners and experienced programmers to get started with coding on the Raspberry Pi.

## Output

### Hello World

Python allows us to output all kinds of things such as graphics and text. To simply output some text to the screen we can use the print() instruction. 

There is a tradition that when all computer science students write their first computer program, the most simple introductory program they write is to make the computer output two words. 

Those words are **“Hello World!”**.

In the `Editor Window` type in the command :

``` python
print (“Hello World!”)
```
and press the `Run` button.

Congratulations! You have just issued your first Python instruction, a simple command to output some characters by using the `“print”` function.

⏰ 5 minute task - **What else can you get the computer to print out?**

## Debugging - Syntax Errors

Now we are going to try something else. Every computer programmer makes mistakes and it's important that you know what to do when this happens. 

Let’s try the same command as before but this time without the quotation marks, type in:

``` python
print (Hello World!)
```
...and press the `Run` button.

You have just made an error! 

You should see some writing appear in red that says `“SyntaxError”`.

What do we think `“SyntaxError"` might mean”?

## Debugging - Name Errors

This time we are going to make a mistake with the name of the print function.

Let's type in this time:

``` python
Print ("Hello World!")
```
...and press the `Run` button.

What do we think `“NameError"` might mean”?

!!! note

    **Computers are really, really useful and they can be used to carry out lots of clever things but you have to remember that computers are also really, really dumb.**

    **So dumb in fact that they don’t know the difference between print spelled with a capital P or not!**

## Inputs

If an output puts data out of the program, an input allows us to put some data in to our program from the outside world. 

Again, Python has many methods that allow this to happen, the most basic of these methods is called `input()`.

In the `Editor Window` type in the following instruction:

``` python
print (input("What's your name?"))
```
...and press the `Run` button.

What just happened?

## Variables

Computers use all sorts of data to perform various tasks. 

`What do we mean by data?`

In programming we need a way to store data so that we can come back and work on it at a later point. 

`To accomplish this we can use variables.`

So far we have used print() to display a string “Hello World”. 

We are going to do the same kind of thing now but this time the string (in this case a name) is stored in a variable instead. 

Last time the String was a static, unchanging value but now it is a dynamic, changeable value. 

We will now going to create `two` variables, these will be called `YourName` and `BestFriend`.

Type in the following command:

``` python
YourName = input("What's your name?")
BestFriend = input("What is your friend's name?")
```
...and press the `Run` button.

> Type in your name and press Enter. 

> Type in your best friends name and press Enter. 

`What just happened?`

It is now possible to always access this data by using the titles you have given those variables in Python.

In the `Editor Window` type in the following instruction:

``` python
print (YourName)
```
...and press the `Run` button.

`What just happened?`

**How could we display our BestFriend?**

Try typing your answer into the editor window and see if it worked....

The input() command allows us to enter some text into our program. We can combine input() with other commands: 

``` { .python .annontate }
print(input(“What is your name?”) #(1)
```

1.  :book:
**This will make Python repeat back the name you type in.**

## Variables

Variables are a way of allowing the computer to remember a single item of data that has been input.

``` { .python .annontate }
yourName = input(“Who are you?”) #(1)
print(yourname) #(2)
```

1.  :book:
**The computer will ask you to enter your name i.e. `Joe Bloggs`. This will then be stored in the variable `"yourName"`**
2.  :book:
**This will then display (print) your variable onto the screen.**

!!! question "Project 1: Introducing Python"

    !!! info "Area of a Triangle"

        <figure markdown="span">
            ![img 1](../../Global_Images/Turing.png){ width="400" }
        </figure>
    
        ==General Problem==

        The `Maths Department` have asked you to create a program that calculates the area of a triangle.

        You can calculate the area of a triangle using the formula 
        
        `area = half base times height.`

        We need to enter Python commands to perform this calculation

        ==Instructions==

        Step 1 - 🔢 Input the values for base and height and make them integer numbers.

        Add the code below to your project

        ``` { .python .annontate }
        base = int(input(“What is the length of the Triangle base? ”))  #(1)
        height =int(input(“What is the height of the Triangle?”))       #(2)
        ```

        1.  
            - **:straight_ruler: Ask the user `“What is the length of the base?”` and wait for the user to type an answer.**
            - **:material-pencil-ruler-outline: The answer is then converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `base` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**
        2.  
            - **:straight_ruler: Ask the user `“What is the height of the Triangle?”` and wait for the user to type an answer.**
            - **:material-pencil-ruler-outline: The answer is converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `height` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**
        
        Step 2 - 🖥️ Display the Answer

        ```{ .python .annontate }
        print(base* height)/ 2 #(1)
        ```

        1.  
            -** 🖥️ Display the answer on your screen**

        Congratulations , You have just carried out a calculation using the two variables (`base and height`)and printed the result on the screen!



    !!! info "Temperature Convertor"

        <figure markdown="span">
            ![img 1](../../Global_Images/Hopper.png){ width="400" }
        </figure>

          ==General Problem==

          Convert the temperature from `degrees celcius` to `degrees farenhiet`

          To complete this algorithm we will need a single variable called `“C”` and we are going to carry out calculations and change the value it is storing one step at a time.

          To convert from Centigrade to Farenheit:

          1. Multiply C by 9,
          2. Divide the answer by 5
          3. Add 32 to the answer

          ==Instructions==

          Step 1 - 🌡️ Get the Temperature:

          ```{ .python .annontate }
          C = int(input(“What is the temperature in C? ”)) #(1)
          ```

          1.  
            - **Ask the user to enter the temperature.**
            - **The answer is converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `C` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**

          Step 2 - 🧮 Create the Calculation

          ```{ .python .annontate }
          C = C * 9  #(1)
          C = C / 5  #(2)
          F = C + 35 #(3)
          ```

          1. 
            - **This takes the value in C, multiply the value in `C` by 9 and store the answer back in C again.**
            - **`C` now contains this new answer.**
          2. 
            - **Take the new value stored in `C` and divided it by 5** and 
            - **Saves the new value back into `C`.**
          3. 
            - **Add 32 to the last answer and store it back into the `C` variable.** 
            - **The number that is now stored in the variable `C` is the orginal temperature converted into ==degrees Fahrenheit!==**

          Step 3 - 🖥️ Display the Answer
          ``` python
          print (C)
          ```

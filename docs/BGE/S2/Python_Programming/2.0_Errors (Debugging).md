## Syntax Errors

Now we are going to try something else. Every computer programmer makes mistakes and it's important that you know what to do when this happens. 

Let’s try the same command as before but this time without the quotation marks, type in:

``` python
print (Hello World!)
```
...and press the `Run` button.

You have just made an error! 

You should see some writing appear in red that says `“SyntaxError”`.

What do we think `“SyntaxError"` might mean”?

## Name Errors

This time we are going to make a mistake with the name of the print function.

Let's type in this time:

``` python
Print ("Hello World!")
```
...and press the `Run` button.

What do we think `“NameError"` might mean”?

!!! note

    **Computers are really, really useful and they can be used to carry out lots of clever things but you have to remember that computers are also really, really dumb.**

    **So dumb in fact that they don’t know the difference between print spelled with a capital P or not!**

        ==General Problem==

        The `Maths Department` have asked you to create a program that calculates the area of a triangle.

        You can calculate the area of a triangle using the formula 
        
        `area = half base times height.`

        We need to enter Python commands to perform this calculation

        ==Instructions==

        Step 1 - 🔢 Input the values for base and height and make them integer numbers.

        Add the code below to your project

        ``` { .python .annontate }
        base = int(input(“What is the length of the Triangle base? ”))  #(1)
        height =int(input(“What is the height of the Triangle?”))       #(2)
        ```

        1.  
            - **:straight_ruler: Ask the user `“What is the length of the base?”` and wait for the user to type an answer.**
            - **:material-pencil-ruler-outline: The answer is then converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `base` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**
        2.  
            - **:straight_ruler: Ask the user `“What is the height of the Triangle?”` and wait for the user to type an answer.**
            - **:material-pencil-ruler-outline: The answer is converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `height` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**
        
        Step 2 - 🖥️ Display the Answer

        ```{ .python .annontate }
        print(base* height)/ 2 #(1)
        ```

        1.  
            -** 🖥️ Display the answer on your screen**

        Congratulations , You have just carried out a calculation using the two variables (`base and height`)and printed the result on the screen!

          ==General Problem==

          Convert the temperature from `degrees celcius` to `degrees farenhiet`

          To complete this algorithm we will need a single variable called `“C”` and we are going to carry out calculations and change the value it is storing one step at a time.

          To convert from Centigrade to Farenheit:

          1. Multiply C by 9,
          2. Divide the answer by 5
          3. Add 32 to the answer

          ==Instructions==

          Step 1 - 🌡️ Get the Temperature:

          ```{ .python .annontate }
          C = int(input(“What is the temperature in C? ”)) #(1)
          ```

          1.  
            - **Ask the user to enter the temperature.**
            - **The answer is converted into a number using the `int()` keyword and stored in the `C` variable so that the computer can use it again later.**

          Step 2 - 🧮 Create the Calculation

          ```{ .python .annontate }
          C = C * 9  #(1)
          C = C / 5  #(2)
          F = C + 35 #(3)
          ```

          1. 
            - **This takes the value in C, multiply the value in `C` by 9 and store the answer back in C again.**
            - **`C` now contains this new answer.**
          2. 
            - **Take the new value stored in `C` and divided it by 5** and 
            - **Saves the new value back into `C`.**
          3. 
            - **Add 32 to the last answer and store it back into the `C` variable.** 
            - **The number that is now stored in the variable `C` is the orginal temperature converted into ==degrees Fahrenheit!==**

          Step 3 - 🖥️ Display the Answer
          ``` python
          print (C)
          ```

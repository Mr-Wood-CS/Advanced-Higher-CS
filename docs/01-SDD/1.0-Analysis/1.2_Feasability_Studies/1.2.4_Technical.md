# 2.4 - Technical Feasability

The technical feasibility study must identify the technologies that will be necessary for the proposed system to function correctly. 

Once identified, the technical feasibility then considers whether or not the technologies necessary are currently available.

* If the required technologies are available, the technical feasibility must determine whether or not the client already has the necessary resources. If not, the resources that must be acquired are identified and suitable hardware and software recommended.

### ==User Survey==

The users of a particular program are the best people to identify the existing problems with the software and how it could be improved.

If the software being developed is new, the target user group should understand the programme. 

> For example, a new library system would be developed following some time spent capturing the experience of existing librarians and how they operate.

When the opinion of a number of users is required, it is often easier to create a survey or questionnaire which will capture the information that the project team require.

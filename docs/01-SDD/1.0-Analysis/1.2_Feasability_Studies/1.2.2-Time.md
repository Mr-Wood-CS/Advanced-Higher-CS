# 2.1 - Time Feasability

The time necessary to develop a new information system is considerable. For this reason, the time feasibility must consider not only the time needed to carry out the development but how this will affect the client.

Time feasibility must take account of:

* overall development time for the project
* events during the year that the business is already committed to
* when best to install the new system
* when is the best time to train users how to use the new system
* when will the  system be ready for use.

Obviously, time is a main factor in the development of a new system.

Questions to be asked at this stage might include:

* How long will the proposed system take to develop?
* Will it be ready within the specified time-frame?
* When is the best time to install?

For example, a project might have to start within six months; assuming it would take three months to purchase and install the required hardware and software and a further six months to train the end users. 

Such a project is not technically feasible because of shortage of time so it would not go ahead unless some of the time constraints were reviewed and changed.
